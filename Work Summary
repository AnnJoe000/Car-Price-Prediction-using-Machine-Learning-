### üìö Detailed Project Description / Work Summary

In this project, I have developed a comprehensive machine learning workflow to analyze and predict car prices in the American automobile market. The project has been structured into multiple stages, each contributing to the final objective of building an accurate regression model and extracting business insights for a Chinese automobile company planning to enter the US market.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset containing various attributes of different car models and their respective prices.
- Cleaned the dataset by handling inconsistencies in textual data (e.g., brand name corrections like ‚Äúvokswagen‚Äù to ‚Äúvolkswagen‚Äù).
- Created a new feature called `brand` by extracting it from the `CarName` column.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format using Label Encoding.
- Applied **feature scaling** using `StandardScaler` to normalize the dataset and improve model performance.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Implementation
Implemented five different regression algorithms to model the relationship between car features and their prices:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

Each model was trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set to analyze its predictive capabilities.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated and compared all five models using key performance metrics:
  - **R-squared Score (R¬≤)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- Identified the best-performing model based on the highest R¬≤ score and lowest error values.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance Analysis
- Used the **Random Forest Regressor** to compute feature importances.
- Visualized the top contributing features affecting car prices.
- Interpreted the impact of significant features (like engine size, horsepower, car width, curb weight, etc.) on the final price of a car.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** for the best model (Random Forest Regressor).
- Optimized parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split` to further improve model performance.
- Evaluated the tuned model and confirmed improvements in performance metrics.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Business Insights
- Through the entire analysis, key factors influencing car prices were identified.
- These insights can be used by the management to strategically design vehicles and determine market-competitive pricing strategies in the US automobile sector.

### ‚úÖ Outcome
A reliable and interpretable machine learning model has been developed to predict car prices, with significant features identified and tuned for better accuracy. This end-to-end pipeline offers a strong foundation for business decision-making in new market ventures.
